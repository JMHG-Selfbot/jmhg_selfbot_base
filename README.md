# jmhg_selfbot_base
a simple base for a discord selfbot written in python using the discord.py api V12

simply run the Prerequisits.bat file(which will install all the nescassary modules needed to run the bot) and put your token in the config.json file
then you can just press JMHG.bat and it will run the JMHG.py file.
you can use this however you like but if you decide to make a commercial selfbot(dont recommend it but ok) please make sure to reference that i made the base :) thanks hun
i am also not responsible for any bans which may occur while using this base, but you should be fine


i shouldnt have to say this but PLEASE HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED, CUS IF YOU DONT THE BOT WONT RUN, AND ALSO HAVE THE MOST UP TO DATE VERSION, IT DOESNT MATTER IF YOU DONT BUT ITS JUST SOMETHING YOU SHOULD DO, ok bye
